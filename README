The paper uses two sets of famous benchmark instances (including 67 instances).
In addition to obtaining these instances at this website, they are also available in the references of this paper.
We give the results of the calculations for each instance and give all the data for plotting the Gantt chart. 
The results of the repeated experiments are also in the folder.
